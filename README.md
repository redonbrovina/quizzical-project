Built an interactive quiz web application with React focused on general knowledge and trivia. The app dynamically renders multiple-choice questions, handles user selections in real-time, and displays the final score at the end of the quiz. It includes features like question shuffling, answer randomization, and a clean, responsive UI. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of React state management, component structure, and conditional rendering.
